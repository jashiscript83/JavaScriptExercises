In this exercise, you need to make some interesting things.
First of all take a look at the html. You'll find three different divs with three different buttons.
Every time that you click every button, "his" div needs to slideDown. (see jquery .slideDown() method).
But here is the trickest thing. When you click any button, if some div is hidden, must to be shown again.
For example: If you click the first button, the first div must be slideDown. If yo click the second button now,
the second div dissapears but the first one must appears.
ONLY the div that has clicked in last, have to be "hidden".
Think about it.
You only can make ONE function for all the buttons.

Clue: Play with classes and "THIS" object.

Good luck!!
