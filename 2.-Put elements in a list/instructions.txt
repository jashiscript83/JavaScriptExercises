I need a function that is able to put elements inside a list in my html.
- First of all you need a list in your HTML. Feel free to create it from HTML or in JS.
- The second thing is to create a function that receives an Array like a parameter.
- For every value of the array you need a different list item in html.

For example:

    myFunction(['color1', 'color2', 'color3']);


Good luck
